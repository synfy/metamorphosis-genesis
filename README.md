# Metamorphosis: Genesis
### Metamorphosis: An Origins Addon

You start as a baby, with more weaknesses than powers, but eventually you grow up into your more powerful adult form. 
Each time you die, though, you start over with a new random origin, and you're back to being a baby again. 
Can be played in a pseudo-hardocre mode, where players only have ten lives, and server ops can reroll origins for players
who get repeats.
Inspired in part by Afterlife SMP (part of the X Life series)

This is the first metamorphosis mod, made for version 1.18.1. It features primarily real organisms, with an emphasis on
a large difference between the playstyles and abilities of adult and baby forms. 

This mod was made for the private server that my friends and I play on, so if you aren't on that server, then I'm not
really sure how you found this. Feel free to play with this mod, though if you're going to add it to a modpack I'd
appreciate a heads-up, use the Issues tab for that.
