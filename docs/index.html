                    <p>Metamorphosis is an Origins addon, which replaces the default origins with 
                        new ones, centered around a theme. You start as a baby, with more weaknesses than powers, but eventually you grow 
                        into your more powerful adult form. Each time you die, though, you start over 
                        with a new random origin, and you're back to being a baby again.</p>

                        This is the first Metamorphosis mod, made for Minecraft version 1.18.1. It features 
                        primarily real organisms, with an emphasis on a large difference between 
                        the playstyles and abilities of adult and baby forms.

                        This mod was made primarily for the private server that my friends and I play on, 
                        so if you aren't on that server, then I'm not really sure how you found this. Feel 
                        free to play with this mod, though if you're going to add it to a modpack I'd 
                        appreciate a heads-up, use the Issues tab on GitHub for that.

                        The growth from the baby version to the adult version is controlled by <span class="spoiler">XP</span>. 
                        In order to grow up, the following condition must be met: <span class="spoiler">player must have 45 levels</span>. 
                        Once the condition is met, the player must <span class="spoiler">sleep in a bed</span> to trigger the growth.

                        This mod can be played with a pseudo-hardcore mode, where players only have ten lives. After their last death, 
                        players will be put into spectator mode and will no longer be able to interact with the world. This is controlled
                        through the scoreboard, so it can be enabled by running this command in chat:
                    </p>
                    <p class="command">
                        /scoreboard objectives add deathCount deathCount ["Deaths"]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Operators on a server, or individuals on single player with cheats enabled can reroll their origin to randomly 
                        reassign a new origin to themselves or others. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="command">
                        /reroll playerName
                    </p>
